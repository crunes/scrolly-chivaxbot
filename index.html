				New Maps, Same Gaps

				Vaccination rates in communities especially vulnerable to COVID-19 have

					On January 25, Mayor Lightfoot and the Chicago Department of Public
					Health (CDPH) announced an initiative called Protect Chicago Plus to
					prioritize fifteen of the most vulnerable neighborhoods, mostly on the
					South and West sides in Black and brown communities, for critical
					COVID-19 vaccines.
				</p>

				<p>
					That same day, South Side Weekly launched ChiVaxBot,
					a daily Twitter bot highlighting the geographic disparities between who
					was dying from COVID-19 and who was vaccinated. Even though the percent
					of fully immune residents in several South and West Side ZIP codes rose,
					the daily maps didn’t seem to change much.
				</p>

				<p>
					After four months of reporting who’s dying from and who’s been vaccinated
					for COVID-19, we’ve decided to update the bot to also illustrate change
					over time. Starting TK, we will be threading a second daily tweet that
					shows a GIF of the percent of fully vaccinated residents by ZIP code,
					week by week.
				</p>

				<p>
					The most important change will be that the GIF maps use the same key.
					For example, one shade will always represent, say, 10 to 20 percent of
					residents fully vaccinated, and another shade will always represent 20
					to 30 percent of residents fully vaccinated, and so on. We hope that
					this clarifies that vaccination rates are in fact improving, while
					still keeping an eye on the disparities between the South and West
					Sides and the rest of the city.
